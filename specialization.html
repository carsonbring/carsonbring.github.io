            <h2>Specialization in the Hive</h2>

            <p> &emsp;     What is the advice that most people give in regards to being successful?  In my experience, I’ve found that the concept of specialization is widely regarded as a good thing by those giving advice.  This sentiment comes from the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, where artisans were replaced by assembly line workers who completed one task over and over again in order to be efficient.  Each human turned into a cog in a living, breathing machine.  While this mentality works perfectly in a factory environment, it is not healthy to the development and evolution of the human mind.  Today, school teaches students that they need to operate as assembly workers with little room for creativity.  I was lucky enough to go to very good pre-university schools where they would push creative processes while learning, and this specialization mentality was still pushed.  After being at my university for only 2 weeks, I can see that a lot of students simply have never been exposed to anything other than sole fixation on their job field.
            <br>
            <br>
            &emsp; Before stating why specialization is a bad thing, I believe it’s important to find out what education should accomplish for its students.  If you are someone who feels that school should teach people how to be a good worker, then maybe you think that specialization is a necessary concept.  I would disagree.  Although getting a job is an important aspect of life, learning how to be a developed, functioning human being should come before fixation on a job.  For example, as a computer science student, I run into a certain type of person almost daily. This type of person is someone who refuses to even attempt to learn or improve on anything besides programming or knowledge of technology.  When these people have to give verbal presentations, they tell themselves “This doesn’t even matter, I’m going into the computer science industry.”  This person will use defeatism as a coping mechanism to compensate for them not being good at something. It doesn’t just happen with public speaking, this mentality can be extended to most subjects.  Although you, the reader, might not be guilty of this, specialization is a mindset used to appropriate and normalize mediocrity.

            &emsp;     What you need to understand is that specialization, in most forms, is an excuse.  Opportunities will be harder to come by since you won’t be looking for said opportunities if they don’t fit a narrow idea of your “field”.  One of the greatest minds in the history of the United States, Thomas Jefferson, was known to be an amatuer everything.  Astronomy, music, writing, scientific theory, and architecture were just some of the many things Jefferson was passionate about.  The hive mind will tell themselves that learning anything other than rational, applicable knowledge is a waste of time and would prevent them from getting things done.  When you think of Thomas Jefferson, a man who was fundamental to the growth of the United States, do you think of a man who was a helpless and impractical intellectual?  No, you don’t.
