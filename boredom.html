Back before I went off to college, my youngest brother was going through a phase where he couldn’t find a video game that kept him entertained. He would boot up GTA, walk around for 5 minutes then turn it off. While this doesn’t really seem like a big deal, one night he went outside for a walk without telling anyone. My mom, worried for my brother, could tell that there was something wrong with the way that he had been acting recently. After talking to her about potential solutions to an unknown problem, I decided to go and find my brother outside. In an early pre-teen fashion, he was pouting. After some deliberation, I got to the point and asked him if anything was wrong. He replied, “I can’t think of anything to do.” For my brother, video games had supplied his brain with a steady trickle of dopamine, but it’s magical effect was wearing off.

The other day, one of my friends and I went out to eat at one of the dining centers at my college. It was around lunch, and in college that means that half of your friends are still asleep. We got our food and then sat by a window near a quiet corner of the noisy cafeteria. After catching up on some of the things that went on last night we sat in silence for a while. Then we both reached for our phones.

	Vices that can help with boredom avoidance have only become better and better at telling your brain that you aren’t bored. These methods won’t make you happy, but they will emulate the natural state of action in its most artificial form. Think of the last time you used social media. Were you happy when you saw a new post on instagram? Were you filled with joy when you saw a new tweet? In most situations, the answer is no. Social media, a prime example, is programmed to try and get your mind to think that it is stimulated. You already knew that though, that’s why this blog title is not “Muh social media bad!!!1!”, but it’s important to understand the “medicine” that big tech companies try to give you to combat the scariest diagnosis to all of us, boredom.

We’re all guilty of it, but why? Why are we so afraid of being bored? A lot of people say that public speaking is the number one fear of most people across the world, because it is a conscious step into the unknown. This might have been the case in the past, but with social media and video games shortening our attention spans, there is a new boogie-man on the block.  The number one fear of modern man is boredom. Think about the last time you had nothing to do. Even if you weren’t bored, in order to prevent yourself from being bored in the future you will pull out your phone and look at notifications. Our brains aren’t meant to function like this.

The state of being bored is probably the most interesting feeling/emotion that a human can experience. Not only is boredom a profound and complex experience, one of the main reasons why I’ve chosen to embrace this emotion is grounded in enginuity. Albert Einstein proclaimed that, “Necessity is the mother of invention”, and while you can look at this quote in a physical sense, the same rings true for the mental state of the inventor.  Boredom is the mother of invention. Even if you aren’t trying to invent the next printing press, boredom presents ideas and clarity.  </p>

You have been socially engineered to hate boredom, and avoid it at all costs. Believe it or not, a lot of people benefit financially, socially, or politically from you ( yes you! :O ) not being bored. All that I’m suggesting is that the next time you are bored, just sit and think. This will be hard, and I’m not saying that the only option is to become a monk who has no access to the internet, but just being bored a couple times per day will make you a better person.
